Toastmasters Website,Freelance Website Development,"I collaborated with a Toastmasters club to create a website showcasing their activities, events, and achievements. Using React JS for the frontend, I leveraged Supabase—a Backend as a Service (BaaS) platform—for efficient data storage and authentication. By eliminating the need for a separate backend server, we saved costs. Throughout development, I worked closely with the club’s executive committee, incorporating their feedback to tailor the website accordingly.",6,https://auroratoastmastersclub.vercel.app,"React JS, Supabase",Website
Scrapify,Web Scraper Application,"Collecting large amounts of data from websites can be challenging, but Scrapify simplifies this process. Developed with a focus on ease of use, Scrapify allows you to specify CSS selectors to efficiently gather the data you need. This tool automates the data collection process, making it ideal for anyone looking to streamline their web scraping tasks. It is built using React JS and Supabase, 2 tools that are known for their efficiency and flexibility.

Autonomous Robot,Embedded Programming,"In the Toyota Innovation Challenge, our team programmed a Turtlebot 4 robot to navigate a course and obey road signs. We started with manual navigation and gradually transitioned to autonomous navigation, implementing obstacle avoidance with LiDAR technology. Using the robot's camera and a custom-trained YOLOv5 model, we successfully detected road signs. Our innovative approach and presentation impressed the judges, earning us one of the prestigious awards.",5,https://github.com/TMMC-challenge-20/tmmc_fleet_control_challenge,"Python, ROS, Ultralytics (YOLOv5)",Code
EMG-controlled Steering Wheel,EMG-Microcontroller Assistive System,"This project aimed to enhance accessibility for double-arm amputees by developing an EMG-controlled steering system capable of turning a wheel at 24 RPM. The setup included a steering wheel assembly, a stool, a servo motor (HSR-1425CR), and a custom 3D-printed gearbox. Two signal-processing circuits, one for each trapezius muscle, were wired to filter input signals, perform full-wave rectification, and peak detection, ensuring a steady output voltage. An Arduino microcontroller was programmed to process these signals, enabling precise control of the steering wheel.",9,https://lbiwfynxcgjkaxaoirql.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/documents/261%20Report.pdf?t=2024-10-02T14%3A53%3A16.344Z,"Arduino, EMG Circuitry",Report
Temperature and Humidity Monitoring,IoT Application,"This IoT application simulates temperature and humidity data and uploads it to an InfluxDB 2.0 database on an AWS EC2 instance. Python was used for data simulation and upload, with a shell script on the EC2 instance to run these Python scripts. A cron job automates the data upload at specified intervals. Additionally, Grafana was installed on the EC2 instance to create a dashboard for data visualization.",3,https://github.com/aadium/temp-humidity-iot-project,"Python, AWS EC2, InfluxDB 2.0, Grafana",Code
Parking Management System,Full-Stack Python Software,"Managing vehicle entry and exit in a parking lot can be challenging, and this application developed using Tkinter for intuitive GUIs makes it easy. The system accommodates 2-wheelers, 4-wheelers, and trucks, each with different charges and designated parking areas, including reserved spots for handicapped drivers. Number plates are recorded using an object detection model, with user correction capability. The system assigns parking based on vehicle type and availability, and bills can be paid by cash, card, or UPI.",2,https://github.com/aadium/parking-system,"Python, tKinter, MySQL",Code
